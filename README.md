# Workoutbuddy
This is my app Workout Buddy which is my first android app.This was just to gain experience writing in android studios.I started this app in 6th grade , and it is basically an app that tracks you around and tells you the distance , speed, average speed and time it took you to do your run or walk.I am also planning to give rewards in the forms of medals and badges after a while.You can also see previous runs and how you did on them.
